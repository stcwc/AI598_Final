# Algorithms Accomplished:
    Vertical Cell Decomposition (VCD) and RRT.

# Running Environment:
    Python 3.5 (2.* should be fine but not guaranteed)
    No additional package depended.

# Run instruction:
    Command line
        for VCD: $ python main.py input.txt VCD
        for RRT: $ python main.py input.txt RRT 1000        //1000 is the number of iterations of RRT.
